## Details
**Application has three routes:**

Each `seat` in `db.json` is represented by object with following properties:

    {
        "id": "s00",
        "cords": {
    	    "x": 0,
    	    "y": 0
        },
        "active": false,
        "reserved": false
    }

- choosing the number of available seats to book,
- functions for proposing `random seats` or `seats next to each other`,
- seats can be reselected from the hall view,
- displaying list with booked seats,
- order and reservation data is stored in `redux store`.
